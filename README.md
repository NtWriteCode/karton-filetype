# Karton Filetype Engine

**A Comprehensive Approach to File Classification for MWDB Karton**

**Introduction**

The Karton Filetype Engine is a powerful tool designed for the MWDB Karton system. It goes beyond conventional file classification by leveraging Google's Magika library and meticulously analyzing files for the most accurate identification of their type. This engine prioritizes comprehensiveness, attempting various classification strategies to ensure the best possible results.

**Key Features**

* **Enhanced Accuracy:** Employing Magika as the foundation, this engine strives to deliver exceptional file type identification.
* **Platform Independence:** Function seamlessly across different operating systems, providing consistent performance.
* **Future-Proof Design:** Planned integration with additional tools like TrID, Apache Tikka, and Linux's `file` command promises further refinement of binary classification capabilities.
* **Streamlined Output:** Focuses on essential details, providing only the following in the output:
    * `kind`: A filetype group
    * `mimetype`: The MIME type of the file
    * `label`: A custom label derived from Magika analysis

**Comparison to Karton-Classifier**

While Karton-Classifier offers file classification, Karton Filetype Engine distinguishes itself by:

* **Singular Task Output:**  Provides a single, well-defined task for clarity and ease of use.
* **Concise Data:**  Delivers only the most relevant information, streamlining your workflow.

**Current Stage of Development**

The Karton Filetype Engine is under active development. We're committed to continuous improvement, incorporating more tools and refining its classification methodology.
